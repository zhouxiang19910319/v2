## Color Scheme

I found a color scheme online then I added my own touch to it.
Then I assigned each color to elements of my site and gave each primary color a darker variant to emphasize the visual hierarchy of the site.

* **Black**
- ![#00001E](https://placehold.it/15/00001E/000000?text=+) `#00001E`
- ![#022444](https://placehold.it/15/022444/000000?text=+) `#022444`


* **Orange**
- ![#C76429](https://placehold.it/15/C76429/000000?text=+) `#C76429`
- ![#FF9356](https://placehold.it/15/FF9356/000000?text=+) `#FF9356`


* **Dark Blue, or whatever this color is called**
* ![#0C8D99](https://placehold.it/15/0C8D99/000000?text=+) `#0C8D99`
* ![#55BDCA](https://placehold.it/15/55BDCA/000000?text=+) `#55BDCA`

* **Grey**
* ![#606060](https://placehold.it/15/606060/000000?text=+) `#606060`
* ![#626262](https://placehold.it/15/626262/000000?text=+) `#626262`

## Pages

### 1. Index Page

* The page people see when they open this site. *Just a title and brief introductory of this site.*

* Each interactive column is representing different content category of the site.

* Each column will "vibrate" more when you hover on the corresponding category on the right hand side.

* Each category will change to its own color once you hover on them.

### 2. Content Page

* Catagories of all the content on the site. Does not contain any article yet.

### 3. Blog Post Page

* Pages that actually contains articles about buddhism.

I created these 3 pages because I felt that without a "proper introductory page" the content page is somehow too naked.

## To do list

1. Frontend Design
   1. - [ ] Index Page
   2. - [x] Content Page
   3. - [ ] Blog Page

2. Figure out the **tech stack** of my site, do I want it to be a static site? Or a JAM stack site? Or to have an actual backend.
